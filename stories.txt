Ben and Mia liked to play with magnets. They had many magnets of different shapes and colors. They liked to stick them on the fridge, on the door, on the table. They liked to see how the magnets pulled or pushed each other.

One day, they found a new magnet in their toy box. It was a ring magnet. It was shiny and silver. It looked very modern. Ben and Mia wondered what it could do.

"Let's try it on the fridge," Ben said.

"OK," Mia agreed.

They ran to the kitchen and put the ring magnet on the fridge. It stuck very well. They tried to pull it off, but it was hard.

She looked at the phone and saw that it was broken. The screen was cracked. The buttons were stuck. The sound was distorted.

She looked at Ben and Mia and said, "This was a very bad idea. You should never put magnets on phones. Magnets can damage phones. Phones are not toys. They are important and expensive. You have to be careful and respectful with them. Do you understand?"

Ben and Mia nodded. They felt sorry and ashamed. They did not mean to break the phone. They did not know that magnets could hurt phones. They just wanted to play and have fun.

They said, "We are sorry, mom. We did not know. We will not do it again. We love you."

Finally, at the end of the day, Millie stopped and sat down outside a old, rich house. As she was sitting there, she spotted a large silver teaspoon on a table in the house.

Millie jumped up with joy and ran over to the house. She reached out to grab the teaspoon but a woman came out of the house and said, "What are you doing here little girl?"

Millie told the woman why she was there and the woman smiled kindly and said, "I am happy to give this teaspoon to you. It was given to me by my grandmother and I think it would be nice for you to have it

One day, Benny found a magazine that had a picture of a strong and brave bear on it. Benny wanted to be like the bear and protect himself from the scary animals.

Benny asked his mommy to help him make a tight cape just like the bear's. His mommy made it for him and Benny felt very brave wearing it. When he went outside to play, he saw a big wolf coming towards him. Benny remembered what he learned from the magazine and put on his cape, feeling very strong.

The wolf tried to scare Benny, but Benny stood tall and protected himself with his cape. The wolf ran away and Benny felt very proud of himself. From that day on, Benny knew that he didn't have to be scared anymore. He had his tight cape to protect him and he felt very brave. The moral of the story is that we can protect ourselves by being brave and using the things we have.

Sara took the whip and ran outside. She swung it in the air and made a loud noise. She felt powerful and happy. She forgot about Tom and his warning.

Once there was a tiny little mouse who lived in a cozy cardboard box. The mouse was very lively and loved to explore the world around him.

One morning, the mouse decided to take a walk outdoors. He came across a group of children playing in the garden. The Mouse was curious about what they were doing, so he hid behind a bush to watch.

The children had all brought with them a snack to eat between their playing. The snacks were all shapes and sizes and the mouse thought they looked delicious. He wanted to fit in with the children, so he grabbed one of the snacks off the ground and ran away with it.

At first the mouse was very happy eating his snack in a safe place, away from the children. But then he noticed something. The other children weren't eating their snacks; they were sharing them with each other, laughing and talking happily.

Lila and Ben were playing in the garden. They liked to dig holes and look for bugs. They found a big worm, a shiny beetle and a funny spider. They put them in a jar and showed them to Mom.

"Look, Mom, we found some friends!" Lila said.

Mom smiled and said, "They are very interesting, but you should let them go soon. They need to live in the soil and the plants, not in a jar."

"OK, Mom, we will," Ben said.

They went back to the garden and dug some more holes. Then they saw something moving under a rock. They lifted the rock and saw a small, brown animal with a long nose and tiny eyes. It was a mole.

"Wow, what is that?" Lila asked.

"It's a mole," Ben said. "It lives under the ground and eats worms and bugs."

"Can we keep it?" Lila asked.

"No, we can't," Ben said. "It's not a pet. It's wild and it might bite us. And it's ugly."

The mole heard Ben and felt sad. It did not think it was ugly. It thought it was beautiful and clever. It could dig tunnels and find food and sense vibrations. It did not like the bright light and the loud noises. It wanted to go back to its home.

"Please, let me go," the mole said in a soft voice.

Lila and Ben heard the mole and were surprised. They did not know moles could talk.

"Did you hear that?" Lila asked.

"Yes, I did," Ben said.

They looked at the mole and saw that it was scared and unhappy. They felt sorry for it.

"OK, we will let you go," Lila said. "We are sorry we bothered you. You are not ugly. You are special."

"Thank you," the mole said. "You are kind."

Lila and Ben gently put the mole back under the rock and covered it with soil. They wiped their hands and went to find Mom. They told her about the mole and what it said. Mom hugged them and said, "You did the right thing. You are good children."

Lily was curious. She used her spoon to poke the seed. It was smooth and round. She said, "It is smooth and round. Can I play with it?"

Her mom said, "Yes, you can play with it. But don't put it in your mouth. It is not for eating. It is for growing new avocados."

Lily smiled. She said, "Okay, mom. I will play with it. And I will eat the avocado and cheese. They are yummy."

From then on, Tweet and Flutter always flew around the cliff instead of over it. They were happy to have each other to tell their secrets and keep each other safe.

Ben does not listen. He says, "No, Lily, it is fun. It tickles my hand. I want to keep it. I will name it Wally."

Lily shakes her head. She says, "You are silly, Ben. You cannot keep a worm. It needs soil and water. It does not belong on the rock. And you need to wash your hand. Come on, let's go to the shower."

Ben makes a face. He says, "I do not want to go to the shower. The shower is cold and wet. It is not fun. I want to stay with Wally."

Lily grabs Ben's hand. She says, "You have to go to the shower, Ben. Mommy said so. She said we have to be clean and tidy. And Wally has to go back to the garden. He will be happier there. Come on, Ben, please."

Ben sighs. He says, "Okay, Lily, fine. But I will miss Wally. He is a good worm. Bye, Wally. See you later."

The new kid said, "I'm Max, and I have a special power. I can freeze things with my breath." Lila and Ben were curious and asked, "How do you do that?" Max said, "Watch this." He blew on a flower and it turned white and stiff. Lila and Ben gasped and said, "Wow, that's cool!"

They played with Max for a while, and he showed them how he could freeze other things, like rocks, leaves, and bugs. Lila and Ben thought he was fun and friendly, but they also felt a little scared of his power. They wondered what would happen if he froze them. They hoped he would not do that.

But Max had a secret. He was not a nice kid. He was a mean kid who liked to hurt others. He only pretended to be nice to trick Lila and Ben. He wanted to freeze them and take their shield and sword.

They turned around and saw Max smiling wickedly. They tried to move, but they could not. They were frozen!

Max laughed and said, "Ha ha, I got you! Now I have your shield and sword, and you can't do anything!" He grabbed their shield and sword and ran away. Lila and Ben felt sad and angry.

"OK, we can share. Your bird is nice. Can I hold it?"

Mia nods and gives Tom the bird. The bird chirps and flaps its wings. Tom and Mia laugh and hug. They are happy. They have a bird.

But then, a rude boy came and jumped on the round thing too. He pushed harder and made them spin faster and faster. Tom and Mia felt dizzy and scared.

"Stop, stop, stop!" they cried.

But the rude boy did not stop. He laughed and said, "No, no, no! I like to spin!"

Tom and Mia wanted to get off, but they could not. They held on tight and closed their eyes. They wished the rude boy would go away.

Then, their mom saw them and ran to them. She grabbed the rude boy and pulled him off the round thing. She scolded him and said, "That is not nice! You are being rude! You have to share and be careful!"

The rude boy looked down and said, "Sorry."

Tom and Mia stopped spinning and got off the round thing. They felt sick and fell to the ground. Their mom hugged them and said, "Are you okay, my loves?"

They nodded and said, "Yes, mom. Thank you."

They decided to play something else and never spin again. They hoped the rude boy would learn to be nice.

Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Jane. Jane had a friend named Joe who was very selfish. Every time Joe would come over to play, he would take all of Jane's toys without asking and leave her nothing to play with.

This made Jane very sad, so she would weep. But she was too scared to tell Joe how she felt.

One day Joe came over with a new toy: it was a spike. He showed it off to Jane and then took away all of her toys again. Jane stared down at the ground and her eyes filled with tears.

Joe saw this and started to feel a little bit guilty. He offered Jane the spike so they could both play together. Jane smiled and hugged it tight.

Joe saw that Jane was happy, and felt much better. From then on, Joe was a lot less selfish and they both had lots of fun playing together!

She grabbed the bottle and said to Ben, "Do not lie to me, Ben! What did you put in your mouth?

Ben said, "Nothing! I was just smelling the bottle. I promise!

But Lily did not believe him. She said, "You should always be alert, Ben. This bottle has poison in it, and if you had taken a sip of this, you would have been very sick!

Ben learnt an important lesson and was careful from that day on. He always stayed alert and reminded himself that some things can be dangerous even if they look nice.

But Jack didn't listen and he grabbed the rope. Suddenly, there was a loud noise! Jack was very scared and he ran away quickly.

John followed him and they both ended up back at home. John said to Jack, "We have to be careful and be aware of our surroundings. Don't go disturbing things that don't belong to us".

One day, Lyle noticed something strange up in the tree. It was a cobweb with lots of sparkles. "What's that?" he asked Everett. Everett didn't know for sure, but he said his mother had told him that when two friends help each other, something good can happen. So Everett and Lyle decided to try and unite with the cobweb.

They worked together to try and get the cobweb down. Everett used his trunk to hold onto it while Lyle used his sharp claws to cut the strings that came out of the web. With their help, the web started to unravel. Everett was excited to see what would come out of it!

Suddenly, a sparkly bear appeared from the web. It flew around the two friends and then landed in front of them. Everett and Lyle were amazed!

"What does zero mean?" Ben asks.

"I don't know," Lily says. "Maybe it means the car has no power."

They look for their mom. They hope she can fix the car. They find her in the kitchen. She is making cookies.

"Mom, mom, our car is broken!" Ben and Lily say.

"Oh, no, what happened?" Mom says.

She follows them to their room. She sees the car and the zero.

"Zero means the car needs new batteries," Mom says. "Batteries are things that make the car go. I have some in the drawer. Let me get them for you."

Mom opens the drawer and takes out two batteries. She opens the car and puts the batteries inside. She closes the car and turns it on. The car makes noises and moves by itself.

"Yay, the car is working!" Ben and Lily say.

They hug their mom and thank her.

"You're welcome, my sweeties," Mom says. "You are very helpful for showing me the problem. Now you can play with your car again. But don't forget to share and be nice to each other."

"Look, my tower is taller than yours!" Lily said, putting more sand on top of her spade.

"No, it's not!" Tom said, doing the same with his spade. "Mine is taller and stronger!"

They kept adding more and more sand, until their spades were too heavy to lift. They tried to pull them out, but they were stuck.

"Help!" Lily cried. "My spade is trapped!"

"Me too!" Tom said. "I can't get my spade out!"

They pulled and pulled, but nothing happened. They started to cry.

A man was walking by with his dog. He saw the children crying and came over.

"What's wrong, little ones?" he asked.

"Our spades are stuck in the sand!" Lily and Tom said.

The man smiled and bent down. He took hold of their spades and pulled them out with ease.

"Here you go," he said, handing them their spades. "You were trying to make a castle, right?"

"Yes, but we made it too big and our spades got stuck," Lily said.

"Well, sometimes less is more," the man said. "Why don't you try to make a smaller castle, but with more details? Like windows and doors and flags?"

"That sounds fun!" Tom said.

"Thank you, mister!" Lily said.

"You're welcome," the man said. "Have fun, but be careful not to dig too deep. The sand can be bitter if you taste it."

He waved and walked away with his dog.

Lily and Tom looked at each other and smiled. They decided to make a smaller castle, but with more details. They used their spades to carve windows and doors and flags. They were happy and proud of their castle. They did not stop until it was done.

Once there was a little boy called Joe. He was three years old and loved to play. He had a cosy room that he loved and he always made sure his toys were in neat piles.

So Joe opened his bedroom door and stepped out into the hallway. He left the house and made his way out into the garden. Joe followed the sunshine and soon he was out of the garden and at the stream. He crossed the stream and continued his way.

Joe had the most wonderful adventure and saw so many new things. After a few hours he realised he was far from home, but he was not scared since he had his fierce belt with him.

Joe eventually made his way back home and went to bed exhausted but happy. He smiled as he snuggled his belt close and fell asleep knowing he was brave and he could go on any adventure he desired.

His family welcomed him back with hugs and love. Fuzzy was so happy to be back with his family and never wanted to forget how to find home again!

"Shh, it's okay, Lily. I'm here." Mommy came from the living room. She picked up Lily and hugged her. "Don't be afraid of the rain. It's just water from the sky. It makes the plants and flowers grow."

"Can we go outside and see the plants and flowers?" Tom asked. He liked the rain. He wanted to splash and jump.

"Not now, Tom. It's too wet and cold. Maybe later, when the rain stops." Mommy said. She smiled at Tom. "Why don't we stay in the kitchen and play some more? Maybe we can make some real food and eat it together."

"Okay, mommy. That sounds good." Tom said. He went back to the kitchen. He found a fake carrot and a fake knife. He pretended to cut the carrot.

"Mom, mom, look what we have for you!" they shouted, as they entered the kitchen.

But their mom did not look happy. She looked angry and scared. She saw the flowers in their hands and gasped.

"Tom, Lily, what have you done?" she cried. "These are not flowers, these are weeds! They are poisonous and dangerous! You could have gotten sick or hurt!"

She quickly took the weeds from their hands and threw them in the trash. She washed their hands with soap and water and checked them for any signs of harm.

Tom and Lily did not understand. They thought they had done something nice for their mom. They felt sad and confused. They did not know why their mom was so mad at them. They started to cry.

Lily and Ben were best friends. They liked to play in the park every day. They liked to swing on the swings, slide on the slides, and run on the grass. But they did not like the maze. The maze was big and dark and scary. They were fearful of the maze.

One day, Lily and Ben were swinging on the swings. They saw a new boy in the park. He was swinging on the swing next to them. He had a big smile and a red hat. He said hello to them.

"Hi, I'm Tom. Do you want to play with me?" he asked.

"Sure, we can play with you. What do you want to play?" Lily said.

"Let's play in the maze. It's fun and exciting. Come on, follow me!" Tom said.

He jumped off the swing and ran to the maze. Lily and Ben looked at each other. They did not want to play in the maze. They were fearful of the maze.

"Tom, wait! We don't like the maze. It's big and dark and scary. We want to play something else." Ben said.

But Tom did not hear them. He was already inside the maze. He was laughing and shouting.

"Come on, don't be scared. The maze is not scary. It's just a game. You can find your way out. It's easy. Trust me!" he said.

Lily and Ben did not trust him. They were fearful of the maze. But they did not want to lose their new friend. They wanted to play with him. They decided to be brave and try the maze.

They held hands and walked slowly to the maze. They entered the maze. They saw many paths and walls and turns. They did not know which way to go. They tried to follow Tom's voice, but it was hard to hear. They felt lost and alone. They were fearful of the maze.

They wished they were back on the swings. They wished they had never met Tom. They wished they could get out of the maze. They started to cry.

"Help! Help! We want to get out! We don't like the maze!" they cried.

Then they heard a familiar voice. It was Tom. He had found them. He had a big smile and a red hat. He was holding a map.

"Don't cry, don't cry. I'm here to help you. I have a map. I know the way out. Follow me!" he said.

He took their hands and led them through the maze. He showed them the right paths and turns. He made jokes and songs. He made them laugh and smile. He was not fearful of the maze. He was fun and kind.

Soon they reached the exit. They saw the sun and the sky and the park. They felt happy and relieved. They were out of the maze.

"See, that was not so bad. That was fun and exciting. You did it! You were brave and smart. You should be proud of yourselves!" Tom said.

He hugged them and gave them the map.

Soon, the rice was ready. Tim and his mom put the rice on their plates and sat down to eat. They both enjoyed the delicious rice that Tim had helped to make. Tim felt proud that he was able to help his mom in the kitchen and be an obedient child.

Once upon a time, there was a little green hanger. He was always very careful when he hung clothes on the line.

One day, he decided to swing as high as he could and let go. He felt like he could trust the wind. But, as he swung, the wind became stronger and stronger. Soon, the hanger lost his grip on the clothesline and flew away.

The hanger was so scared. He tried to find something to hold on to, but he couldn't see anything. He yelled out, "Help me! I'm falling!"

But, no one came to save the small green hanger. He kept falling until he landed on the ground. He was never seen again.

The little green hanger had learned the hard way that he couldn't always trust the wind. Sometimes, trusting can lead to bad things.

"Can we pick it?" Lily asked.

"No, we have to wait until it is ready," Max said. He wanted to show the cauliflower to their mom and dad.

"Look, I have it!" Lily said. She ran to the house with the cauliflower.

Max was angry and sad. He chased after Lily. He wanted to put the cauliflower back in the ground.

"Stop, Lily, stop!" Max shouted. "You are not supposed to do that!"

"Look what I found in the garden!" Lily said.

Mom and dad looked at the cauliflower. They looked at Lily. They looked at Max.

They were not happy.

"Lily, you should not have picked the cauliflower," mom said. "It was not ready yet. You have to be patient and respectful of nature."

"Lily, you should not have run away from me," Max said. "I wanted to show the cauliflower to mom and dad too. You have to be fair and share with your brother."

Lily felt sorry. She realized she had made a mistake. She hugged Max and gave him the cauliflower.

"Look, mom, look what I found!" Lily said. "Can I keep it? Please, please, please?"

Mom looked at the jar and frowned. She did not like bugs. She thought they were icky and dirty. She did not want them in the house.

"No, Lily, you can't keep it," mom said. "It's not a pet. It belongs in the garden. You have to let it go."

Lily felt sad and angry. She loved her beetle. She wanted to keep it. She did not want to let it go.

"But mom, I promise I will take good care of it," Lily said. "I will give it water and leaves and a name. I will be nice to it. Please, mom, please."

Mom shook her head. She did not change her mind. She said Lily had to let the beetle go or she would be in trouble.

Lily did not listen. She hid the jar under her bed and hoped mom would not find it. She thought she was clever. She thought she could keep her beetle.

But she was wrong. The next day, when she came home from school, she saw the jar on the table. The lid was off. The beetle was gone. Mom was waiting for her with a stern look.

"Lily, what did you do?" mom asked. "You broke your promise. You lied to me. You did a bad thing."

Lily felt sorry and scared. She did not mean to do a bad thing. She just wanted to keep her beetle. She looked for it in the garden, but she could not find it. She lost her beetle and she made mom mad.

She started to cry. She said she was sorry. She said she would not do it again.

Mom hugged her and said she forgave her. She said she loved her. She said she understood. She said she would help her find another bug to play with in the garden. But she said she had to let it go when she was done.

Lily nodded. She learned her lesson. She said she would keep her promise. She said she would let the bug go. She said she loved mom too. She said she was happy.

CRASH!

Sam and Lily hit the tree with a loud noise. They fell off the swing and landed on the ground. They felt a lot of pain. They cried and screamed.

"Ow, ow, ow! My head hurts!" Sam said.

"Ow, ow, ow! My arm hurts!" Lily said.

They looked at each other. They saw blood and bruises. They were scared and sad. They wanted their moms and dads.

"Sam, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!" Lily said.

"Lily, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!" Sam said.

They hugged each other. They tried to comfort each other. But they did not feel better. They felt worse. They wished they had not played on the swing. They wished they had played something else. They wished they had listened to their moms and dads. They learned a hard lesson. They never played on the swing again.

But after they had been sorting for a while, Jill started to get anxious. She said to Jack, "This is taking too long. Can we go now?" Jack looked up and said, "Just one more minute."

So the little dinosaur started to climb the tree. He was very slow, but he finally made it to the top. He was so excited that he shouted, "I did it!"

At the top of the tree, the little dinosaur saw a bird's nest. He asked his friend, "What's that?" His friend said, "That's a bird's nest. Let's see if we can see the little baby birds inside."

The bird passed through the door and there was a lady inside. The bird hop-hopped up to the lady, who smiled at her. The lady said she was the veterinarian and she could help her. The bird was happy, and the veterinarian took her to a special room.

The veterinarian took out a bright light and looked at the bird's feet. She said the bird was healthy and she passed the test. The bird thanked the veterinarian, and the veterinarian said she could go back and fly.

The bird flapped her wings, and it felt so good. She flew high into the sky, a happy green bird.

Ben and Lily were playing by the pond. They liked to watch the fish and the ducks swim in the water. They also liked to throw stones and sticks into the pond and see the ripples.

"Look, Lily, I found a big branch!" Ben said, holding a long and thick stick. "I can use it as a boat!"

He put the branch in the water and tried to push it with his hands. But the branch was too heavy and it sank.

"Oh no, Ben, your boat is gone!" Lily said, feeling sorry for her brother.

Ben was sad. He wanted to get his branch back. He took off his shoes and socks and rolled up his pants. He stepped into the pond and felt the cold water on his feet.

"I can swim and get it!" he said, bravely.

But Ben was not a good swimmer. He was clumsy and he splashed a lot. He could not reach the branch. He only got wet and muddy.

"Ben, come back, it's too deep!" Lily shouted, worried.

She ran to the edge of the pond and reached out her hand. Ben saw her and grabbed her hand. She pulled him out of the water and hugged him.

"Are you okay, Ben?" she asked, softly.

"I'm okay, Lily, thank you," he said, shivering.

They walked back to their mom, who was sitting on a bench. She saw them and smiled.

"What happened, my darlings?" she asked, kindly.

"We were playing with a branch, but it sank and Ben tried to swim and get it, but he couldn't and he got wet and Lily helped him and we're sorry, mom," they said, quickly.

Mom laughed and wrapped them in a towel.

"It's okay, my darlings, I'm glad you're safe and you helped each other. But next time, be careful and don't go into the pond without me, okay?" she said, gently.

"Okay, mom," they said, nodding.

They snuggled with mom and watched the fish and the ducks swim in the water. They forgot about the branch. They were happy.

Tim and Kim are twins. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a gray cat in a tree. The cat is scared and meows. Tim and Kim want to help the cat.

They look for a ladder, but they do not find one. They look for a rope, but they do not find one. They look for a big stick, but they do not find one. They are sad and do not know what to do.

Then, they see a big dog. The dog is tough and strong. He can run fast and jump high. Tim and Kim have an idea. They call the dog and show him the cat. The dog barks and runs to the tree. He jumps and catches the cat in his mouth. He brings the cat to Tim and Kim.

The cat is not hurt. He is happy and purrs. Tim and Kim are happy too. They pet the cat and the dog. They thank the dog for his rescue. The dog wags his tail and licks their faces. They are all friends. They play in the park until it is time to go home.

Tom and Mia were friends who liked to play with clay. They made many things with clay, like animals, cars, and houses. One day, they decided to make a volcano with clay. They used a big bottle as the base and covered it with brown clay. They made a hole at the top and put some red clay inside.

"Look, our volcano is ready!" Tom said. "Let's pretend it can erupt and make lava!"

"How do we make lava?" Mia asked.

"We need something that can melt and be hot and red," Tom said. He looked around and saw a box of crayons. He took some red crayons and broke them into pieces. He put them in a small pot and asked Mia to help him carry it to the kitchen.

"Can we use the stove?" Mia asked.

"Yes, but we have to be careful. It is very hot and can burn us," Tom said. He turned on the stove and put the pot on it. He watched as the crayons started to melt and become liquid.

"Wow, it looks like lava!" Mia said.

"Let's take it to our volcano and make it erupt!" Tom said. He used a big spoon to scoop some of the melted crayons and poured it into the hole of the volcano. The red liquid flowed down the sides of the volcano and made a mess on the floor.

"It looks so cool!" Mia said.

"It looks so rich!" Tom said.

They heard a loud voice from the living room. It was Tom's mom.

"Tom! Mia! What are you doing in the kitchen? Come here right now!"

Tom and Mia looked at each other and ran to the living room. They saw Tom's mom holding a newspaper. She looked very angry.

"Look at this! You ruined my newspaper with your crayons! It was a very important newspaper! It had a lot of rich people and their houses in it! How could you do this?"

Tom and Mia felt very sorry. They did not mean to ruin the newspaper. They only wanted to play with their volcano.

"We are sorry, mom. We did not know it was your newspaper. We were making lava for our volcano," Tom said.

"Your volcano? What volcano?" Tom's mom asked.

Tom and Mia took her to the kitchen and showed her their volcano. They explained how they made it with clay and crayons.

Tom's mom looked at their volcano and the mess on the floor. She was still angry, but she also saw how creative and clever they were.

"I see. You made a very nice volcano, but you also made a very big mess. You have to clean it up and apologize to me. And no more playing with crayons on the stove. It is very dangerous. Do you understand?"

Anna and Ben were confused. They didn't know what a quarter was. They thought it was more special than that.

"But it's so shiny and pretty," Anna said.

"And it has a picture of a man with a hat," Ben said.

Mom explained, "That's George Washington. He was a wise man who helped our country a long time ago. He was the first president. He's on the quarter because he's important."

"Wow, look at all the ants!" Sam says. "They are busy. What are they doing?"

"I don't know," Mia says. "Maybe they are looking for food. Or water. Maybe they are thirsty too."

Sam and Mia feel sorry for the ants. They want to help them. They have an idea.

"Wait here," Sam says. He runs inside and gets a cup of water. He comes back and pours some water on the ground near the step. He makes a small puddle.

"Here, ants," he says. "You can drink this. It is cool and wet. It will make you happy."

Mia smiles. She thinks Sam is kind and smart. She watches the ants. Some of them stop and go to the puddle. They drink the water. They look happy.

"See, they like it!" Mia says. "You are a good friend, Sam."

Sam and Mia hug. They are happy too. They go inside and drink some water. They are not thirsty anymore. They are ready to play more. They are good friends.

Once upon a time, there were two friends named Jack and Jill. Jack wanted to be the king of the land and always told Jill that he would be the one to rule. But Jill didn't like this and refused to surrender to Jack.

One day, when Jack was playing with his cushion, Jill took it away. Jack was so angry, he started to yell at her! He said "Give me back my cushion!"

But Jill refused, throwing it from one side of the room to the other! She said "No way! I'm not going to surrender!"

Jack wasn't about to give in. He grabbed the cushion and headed for the door. But Jill was quicker and managed to get there first, standing with her feet firmly on the ground.

Jack tried pulling her away from the door, but it was no use. For the third time, he said "Give me back my cushion!"

Finally, Jill agreed to give it back, but only on one condition: that Jack agreed to share the cushion with her, using it at regular intervals. Jack agreed, and they both ended up sharing the cushion and ruling the land together.
The end.

They sit in big chairs and eat popcorn. The film starts. They see lions, monkeys, birds and more. The animals do funny things. Lily and Tom laugh a lot. They think the film is jolly.

But then, a big snake comes on the screen. It is scary. It hisses and tries to bite a mouse. Lily and Tom do not like the snake. They hide behind their popcorn. They want the snake to go away.

"Shh, it's okay," Lily's mum says. "It's not real. It's just a film. The snake can't hurt you."

Lily and Tom peek at the screen. The mouse runs away from the snake. The snake slithers away. The film shows other animals again. They are happy and safe.

Lily and Tom feel better. They smile and hug each other. They watch the rest of the film. They seem to enjoy it. They clap when the film ends. They say thank you to Lily's mum. They had a good time.

Once upon a time there lived a boy named Jack. He was curious to explore the world around him. One day he decided to take a walk in the forest. While walking, he saw a large whip! Jack wondered what it was and was so curious that he decided to take it.

When Jack brought the whip back home, his mom saw him and asked him where he got it. Jack told his mom he found it in the forest. His mom said "I think it is better if you remain here with me, Jack!"

Jack was disappointed and started to cry. His mom hugged him and said, "Don't worry, Jack! We can go back to the forest tomorrow and leave it back where it was".

Jack was so excited and couldn't wait to go back to the forest the next day. He grabbed his mom's hand and said, "Let's go, Mom!". So the next day, Jack and his mom went back to the forest and found the same spot where Jack had found the whip. They left it there, and Jack smiled happily, knowing that he had done the right thing.

Once upon a time there lived a happy little boy named Jack. He loved to play outside and make new friends.

One day, Jack was playing in the park when he stumbled upon an old, rusty trap. It was a scary sight. He froze as he tried to remember where he had seen something like it before.

Jack called out to his friend, "Hey, do you know what this is?"

His friend replied, "I think it's an animal trap. People use it to trap animals but it looks dead now."

Jack remembered hearing a story about animal traps that his grandma had told him. He shivered. He was glad he was safe from the trap's danger.

Jack and his friend decided it was best to leave the trap and never come back. They ran away as fast as they could and never looked back.

The End.

Anna and Ben were twins who liked to visit their grandma every week. Grandma lived in a big house with a nice garden and many toys. She was wealthy and gave them gifts and treats. Anna and Ben loved their grandma very much.

One day, when they went to visit her, they saw smoke coming out of her house. They were scared and ran to the door. They knocked and shouted, "Grandma, grandma, are you okay?" But no one answered. They saw a fire truck and some firefighters coming to help. They hoped grandma was safe.

The firefighters put out the fire and brought grandma out. She was coughing and had some burns. She hugged Anna and Ben and said, "I'm so glad you're here. I'm sorry, my house is ruined. I was cooking and forgot to turn off the stove. The fire started and spread quickly. I couldn't get out."

Anna and Ben felt sorry for grandma. They said, "We're sorry too, grandma. We don't care about your house or your toys or your gifts. We care about you. You're the best grandma in the world. We love you."

Grandma smiled and said, "Thank you, my darlings. You're the best twins in the world. I love you too. You know, I learned a lesson today. Having a lot of money and things doesn't make you happy. Having a loving family and friends does. I'm lucky to have you."

The moral value of the story is: Family and love are more important than money and things.

Sam and Mia like to play at the park. They like to swing, climb and slide. One day, they see a big slide that they have never tried before. It is very high and very long.

"Let's go on the big slide!" Sam says. He runs to the ladder and climbs up.

"Wait for me!" Mia says. She follows him, but she is a little scared.

They reach the top of the slide and look down. It is very steep and very fast.

"Are you ready?" Sam asks.

"I don't know," Mia says. "It looks scary."

"Don't worry, I will go first and catch you," Sam says. He is brave and wants to be a hero. He sits on the slide and pushes himself down.

"Whee!" he shouts as he slides down. He feels the wind in his hair and the sun on his face. He reaches the bottom and lands on the grass. He is happy and proud.

"Come on, Mia, it's fun!" he calls to her.

Mia looks at Sam. He is smiling and waving at her. She wants to try the slide too, but she is still scared.

"Maybe I can do it," she says to herself. She sits on the slide and holds on to the sides. She closes her eyes and slides down.

"Ahh!" she screams as she slides down. She feels the slide go up and down and twist and turn. She opens her eyes and sees the ground coming closer. She is scared and excited.

She reaches the bottom and slides off the slide. She bumps into Sam and they both fall on the grass. They are both messy and dirty, but they are also happy and laughing.

"You did it, Mia, you did it!" Sam says. He hugs her and helps her up.

"You are my hero, Sam, you are my hero!" Mia says. She hugs him back and thanks him.

They look at each other and smile. They are friends and they like to slide. They run to the slide again and slide down together. They have fun at the park.

Sara was sad. She missed her mom and dad. They went to work and left her with Nana. Nana was nice, but Sara wanted her mom and dad.

Nana saw Sara crying on the couch. She came over and gave her a hug. "What's wrong, Sara?" she asked.

"I want mom and dad," Sara sobbed. "They are gone for a long time."

Nana wiped Sara's tears and smiled. "They will be back soon, Sara. They love you very much. They are working hard to make money for you and them. Do you know what money is?"

Sara nodded. "Money is what you use to buy things. Like toys and clothes and food."

"That's right, Sara. And sometimes, mom and dad have to work a lot to buy those things. But they always think of you and miss you too. They will call you later and tell you how much they love you. Do you want to hear their voices?"

Sara nodded again. She liked to hear mom and dad's voices. They made her feel happy and safe.

Nana took Sara to the phone and dialed a number. She handed the phone to Sara. "Here, Sara. Say hello to mom."

Sara heard mom's voice on the phone. "Hi, Sara. How are you, my sweetie?"

"Hi, mom. I miss you," Sara said.

"I miss you too, Sara. I love you so much. Are you having fun with Nana?"

Sara looked at Nana, who smiled and winked. "Yes, mom. Nana is nice. She comforted me when I was sad. She gave me a hug and a kiss."

"That's good, Sara. Nana is very kind and caring. She loves you too. You are lucky to have her. And you know what? I have a surprise for you when I come home."

"What is it, mom?" Sara asked, curious.

"It's a secret, Sara. But I'll give you a hint. It's something yummy that you like to eat. Can you guess what it is?"

Sara thought for a moment. She liked to eat many things. But there was one thing that she liked the most. It was sweet and soft and had many colors. "Is it cake, mom?" she guessed.

Mom laughed. "You are very smart, Sara. Yes, it is cake. I bought a cake for you and dad and me. We will have a special treat tonight. How does that sound?"

Sara clapped her hands and smiled. "That sounds great, mom. I love cake. Thank you, mom."

"You're welcome, Sara. I can't wait to see you and hug you and eat cake with you. But now I have to go back to work. I'll talk to you later, okay?"

"That's very nice, Sara. Mom is very thoughtful and generous. She wants to make you happy. You are lucky to have her. And she is lucky to have you. You are a good girl, Sara. You are brave and patient and polite. You make mom and dad proud."

Sara felt warm and fuzzy inside. She was happy to have Nana and mom and dad. They all loved her and she loved them. She learned that sometimes, mom and dad had to work, but they always came back. And sometimes, Nana had to comfort her, but she always made her feel better. And sometimes, they had a yummy cake, but they always shared it. They had a good rhythm of life. They were a happy family.

Suddenly, Jane noticed something strange moving around inside the microscope. It was a tiny creature, and it was resisting her attempts to grab it. Jane tried and tried but she just couldn't catch it!

Jane wanted to explore this new creature so she asked her parents if she could try and figure out what it was. They said yes and Jane was so excited.

She got out her magnifying glass and studied the tiny creature. After a few minutes, Jane realized it was a weird kind of bug. She had never seen one before and she felt proud that she had figured it out.

The puppy wagged its tail at Steve, but then it started to bark.

"What's the matter? It looks like you're scared" said Steve.
The puppy just kept barking and wouldn't stop.

Steve was concerned and he worried that the puppy was lost or hurt. He then noticed a man with a concerned look on his face walking towards him. The man asked Steve what was happening.

He was used to hearing his mom and dad talking but now there was only silence. He was a little bit scared but also a bit excited to explore. He looked around and noticed a small path next to him. He started to walk down it, feeling very brave. He soon happily ran off to find adventure.

Lily and Ben like to play in the kitchen. They find a big bowl and a spoon. They want to make a cake.

"What do we need to make a cake?" Lily asks.

"We need flour and eggs and milk and sugar," Ben says.

They look for the ingredients in the cupboards and the fridge. They put them in the bowl. They start to mix them with the spoon.

"Mix, mix, mix," they sing. "We are making a cake!"

But they mix too hard and too fast. The batter splashes out of the bowl. It makes a big mess on the table and the floor and their clothes.

"Oh no!" Lily says. "We are wet and sticky!"

They hear Mom coming. They are scared. They hide under the table.

"Who made this mess?" Mom says. She sees the bowl and the spoon and the batter. She sees Lily and Ben hiding under the table.

"Did you do this?" Mom asks.

Lily and Ben nod. They are sorry.

"We wanted to make a cake," Lily says.

Mom sighs. She is not happy. But she is not angry.

"Next time, you have to ask me first," Mom says. "And you have to be careful and gentle when you mix."

She helps them clean up the mess. She puts their wet clothes in the washing machine. She gives them new clothes.

She finds a cookie in her pocket. She breaks it in half. She gives one half to Lily and one half to Ben.

"Here, this is your cake for today," Mom says. "Maybe tomorrow we can make a real cake together."

But then, Timmy saw a man walking by and he was being very selfish. He was pushing other people out of the way to get to where he wanted to go.

The cop saw the man and said, "I'm sorry, Sir, but you can't be so selfish."

The man stopped what he was doing and said he was sorry.

The cop then gave the man a stern warning and said, "You need to be more considerate or I will have to give you a ticket."

Suddenly, he spotted a little girl nearby. She had a bucket of food and she was happy to feed the fox. The fox was so excited and he gobbled up all the food in the bucket. He was very happy and his tummy was full.

Lily and Ben were very happy to move to a new house. They had many boxes with their toys and clothes. They wanted to unpack them and play in their new rooms.

"Can we unpack now, Mom?" Lily asked.

"Not yet, sweetie. We have to wait for Dad to come home. He has the keys to the rooms," Mom said.

Lily and Ben were sad. They wanted to unpack now. They looked around the living room. They saw a big couch. It was red and blue and yellow. It had many shapes on it. It was a unique couch.

"Wow, look at this couch!" Ben said. "It looks like a puzzle. Let's play on it!"

Lily and Ben climbed on the couch. They jumped and bounced and slid. They had fun. They did not see the sign on the couch. It said: "Do not sit on the couch. It is very old and fragile. It will break."

The couch made a loud noise. It cracked and snapped and collapsed. Lily and Ben fell to the floor. They were hurt and scared. They cried.

Mom heard the noise. She ran to the living room. She saw the broken couch and the crying children. She was angry and worried.

"What have you done?" Mom yelled. "This couch was very special. It belonged to Grandma. She gave it to us as a gift. It was very expensive and rare. You have ruined it!"

Lily and Ben felt very bad. They said they were sorry. They did not mean to break the couch. They just wanted to play.

Mom did not listen. She said they were naughty and careless. She said they had to go to their rooms and stay there. She said they could not unpack or play until Dad came home. She said he would be very mad too.

Lily and Ben went to their rooms. They were sad and lonely. They wished they had not played on the couch. They wished they had waited to unpack. They wished they had a different new house. They wished they had a different mom.

Once upon a time, there was a happy little boy named Tim. Tim loved trains and would watch them go by his house every day. One day, Tim saw a train that looked different from the others.

His mom smiled and said, "Don't worry, Tim. We can go see the train together tomorrow. Tim's frown turned into a big smile and he was happy again.

But the fox was naughty and didn't listen. He picked it up and got a thorn stuck in his paw. He started crying and the rabbit hurried over to help him. The rabbit carefully removed the thorn and then cursed himself for not protecting his friend.

The fox learned a valuable lesson that day about why it's important to listen to others. The rabbit also learned a lesson about protecting his friend. They grew closer and remained friends.

Toby found a patch of grass by the stream and sat down. He heard the sound of water running and the oat softly swaying in the wind. He felt so peaceful and content. It felt like he could stay there forever.

Suddenly he could feel something tickling his head. He looked up and saw that hundreds of oat straws had fallen on him. He had been so careless that he hadn't noticed the oat straws falling from the trees.

Toby laughed and brushed the oat straws off his head. Then he jumped up and ran back home, his red jacket billowing in the wind. He had a wonderful day and he now knew the feeling of being surrounded by nature.

John and Jane looked in amazement as the dog licked John's face. The dog was no longer wild - it was very friendly! John and Jane laughed and decided to take the pet home with them.

Now the little girl knows how to enjoy meals in a very wise way. Eating was never so much fun!

One day, she woke up and saw a cart parked outside her house. It had a big wheel and a wooden box on the top. She was curious, so she went up to take a closer look. She noticed a little girl sitting in the cart.

The little girl said hello to Wanda and asked if she could take the cart for a ride. Wanda said no, but the little girl was determined and kept asking her. Wanda was starting to get annoyed, but then she suddenly had a wise thought. She said it was alright if the little girl wanted to take the cart but reminded her that she would have to be careful.

The little girl thanked Wanda, jumped into the cart, and disappeared into the distance. Wanda smiled and watched her go. She had used her wisdom to turn the conflict into something positive.

Once upon a time, there was an ancient man. He would come down to the river to bring bananas for his family.

One day, as he was picking up some bananas, he heard a little voice.

"Can you bring me a banana too?" asked the little voice.

The old man looked around and, to his surprise, he saw a small child. He was three years old and was looking up at the ancient man with big bright eyes.

The old man kindly smiled and said, "Yes, I can bring you a banana."

The old man brought some bananas home to his family and he also shared one with the young child.

The old man taught the young child that it was important to be kind and generous to everyone, no matter how big or small they are.

The moral of the story is to remember to be kind and generous to everyone.

One day, a little boy named Tim went for a walk. He saw a mysterious igloo in the snow. He was very curious and wanted to see what was inside.

As Tim got closer, he could hear voices coming from the igloo. He was a little scared, but he wanted to know who was talking. Tim peeked inside the igloo and saw two animals talking to each other. One was a big bear and the other was a small rabbit. They were arguing about who should live in the igloo.

"I found it first," said the bear. "I should live here."

"But I need a home too," said the rabbit. "It's very cold outside."

Just then, George's mom showed up and asked the man, "What do you think you are doing?"

The man said, "I'm just trying to help him".

Jack's mom smiled at him and said, "See, Jack, I told you that if you were patient and kept your hope up, you'd get to pick the rhinoceros one day."

Mia looked around the garden and tried to guess where Leo was. She saw the swing, the slide, the sandbox, but no Leo. She wondered if he was behind the tree or under the table. She decided to check the tree first. She walked slowly and quietly, hoping to scare Leo.

But when she reached the tree, she saw something that scared her instead. It was a big, round, white thing with green leaves. It looked like a giant cauliflower, but it had eyes and a mouth. It was a cauliflower monster!

The cauliflower monster saw Mia and opened its mouth. It said in a loud and scary voice, "Hello, little girl. Do you want to be my snack?"

Mia screamed and ran away. She was very afraid of the cauliflower monster. She wanted to find Leo and go back to the house.

Leo heard Mia scream and came out of his hiding spot. He saw the cauliflower monster and realized it was not a real monster. It was a puppet that his dad had made for a joke. He felt bad for scaring Mia. He ran after her and called her name.

"Mia, Mia, wait! It's not a real monster, it's a puppet! I'm sorry, I didn't know it was there. Please don't be mad at me!"

Mia stopped and turned around. She saw Leo holding the puppet and smiling. She realized it was a joke and felt silly for being scared. She smiled back and said, "It's okay, Leo. You didn't scare me, you just surprised me. But next time, don't hide behind a cauliflower. It's not a good spot."

"Lily, what did you do?" she asked.

"I wanted to feed Anna perfume, Mommy. I thought she would like it," Lily said.

Lily nodded. She felt sorry for Anna. She hugged her and said, "I'm sorry, Anna. I won't feed you perfume again. I love you."

Mommy smiled and said, "That's good, Lily. I love you too. Now let's go wash Anna's hair and dress. And next time, ask me before you use my perfume, okay?"

One day, Tim went to his friend Anna's house to play. Anna also had a microscope, but it was bigger and newer than Tim's. Anna showed Tim her microscope and said, "Look, my microscope is better than yours. It can see more things and has more lights. Do you want to try it?"

Tim felt hurt by Anna's words. He thought Anna was being mean and rude. He said, "No, I don't want to try your microscope. My microscope is good enough for me. I don't need a bigger or newer one. I like my microscope."

Anna was surprised by Tim's answer. She said, "But why? Don't you want to see more things and learn more things? Don't you want to have fun with my microscope? It's not nice to refuse a friend's offer."

Tim said, "It's not nice to make fun of a friend's gift. My dad gave me my microscope and I love it. It's special to me. You should be happy with what you have and not brag about what you have. That's not how friends behave."

Anna realized that Tim was right. She felt sorry for hurting Tim's feelings. She said, "You're right, Tim. I'm sorry for being mean and rude. I didn't mean to hurt you. I was just excited to share my microscope with you. I'm happy that you love your microscope. Can we still be friends and play with our microscopes together?"

Tim smiled and said, "Yes, we can still be friends and play with our microscopes together. Maybe we can learn from each other and see different things. Thank you for saying sorry. I'm sorry for refusing your offer. Let's have fun with our microscopes."

The moral of the story is: Be respectful of other people's feelings and belongings. Don't judge or boast about what you have or don't have. Be grateful for what you have and share it with others. Friendship is more important than things.
